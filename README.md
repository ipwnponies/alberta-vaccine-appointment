# alberta-vaccine-appointment

## What is this

Query several pharmacies for covid appointment availability.
Because, despite the global pandemic always in the foreground, I still have shit I want to do in my life that doesn't involve periodically refreshing 4 poorly designed webpages.
I have video games to play.

## But why though

The covid vaccination rollout in Alberta leaves much to be desired.
Letting a bunch of pharmarcies administer the shot is a great idea, they're already established and are roughly distributed to service the population.
Through the invisible forces of the free market.

What is not great is distributing the appointments.
This is a global pandemic and it's not like getting the annual flu shot, where people can elect to get it anytime over the course of 4 months.
A pharmacy in a neighbourhood full of healthy young people is going to sit idle.
It's probably more efficient to consolidate a single queue with multiple workers.
To analogize to supermarkets, we need a single line-up, with many cashier lanes.
What we might end up with instead is a lane that's blocked and a bunch of other empty lanes.

Anyways, I don't have to power to make government bodies work more efficiently.
But at least with this script, you won't spend hours of waking life trying to fill out digital paperwork.
